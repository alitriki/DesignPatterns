# Java Design Patterns Exercise Suite

Welcome to the Java Design Patterns Exercise Suite! This suite is designed to help you practice implementing various creation and structural design patterns in Java. Each exercise focuses on a specific design pattern and provides you with a set of requirements and guidelines to follow.

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise follows a similar structure to ensure consistency and clarity. Here's a breakdown of the typical exercise structure:

1. **Exercise Title**: The title of the exercise, specifying the design pattern to be implemented.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the exercise and the problem it aims to solve.
3. **Requirements**: A list of functional and non-functional requirements that should be met during the implementation.
4. **Instructions**: Step-by-step instructions on how to approach and implement the design pattern.
5. **Additional Resources**: An example code snippet or diagram demonstrating the expected behavior of the design pattern.
6. **Solution**: A sample solution to the exercise for reference will be provided in a branch of the repo with the name of the exercise. Note that this section should only be referenced after attempting the exercise on your own.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Java Design Patterns Exercise Suite, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the exercise suite repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the exercise folder corresponding to the design pattern you want to practice.
4. Read the exercise description and requirements carefully.
5. Implement the design pattern based on the provided instructions.
6. Validate your solution.
7. Compare your implementation with the sample solution (if needed) in the "Solution" section.
8. Read the additional ressources for more in depth information about the Design pattern.
9. Repeat the above steps for the remaining exercises.

## Exercise List

Here's a list of exercises included in the Java Design Patterns Exercise Suite:

1. Singleton Design Pattern
2. Factory Method Design Pattern
3. Abstract Factory Design Pattern
4. Builder Design Pattern
5. Prototype Design Pattern
6. Adapter Design Pattern
7. Bridge Design Pattern
8. Composite Design Pattern
9. Decorator Design Pattern
10. Facade Design Pattern
11. Flyweight Design Pattern
12. Proxy Design Pattern

Feel free to attempt the exercises in any order that suits your learning goals. It's recommended to start with the foundational patterns like Singleton and gradually move towards more complex ones.

## Additional Resources

If you need additional resources to study and understand the design patterns before attempting the exercises, refer to the following:

1. Book: "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides.

## Builder Design Pattern
The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of complex objects from their representation. It allows the creation of objects step by step, with different configurations, while ensuring a consistent construction process. The pattern provides a way to construct objects by using a builder class that encapsulates the construction logic.

## Context
In this exercise, you will work on a project that involves creating different types of pizzas using the Builder design pattern. The goal is to understand how the Builder pattern can be used to construct complex objects in a flexible and organized manner.

## Instructions
1. List itemCreate a PizzaBuilder class as an inner class of the Pizza class.
2. Add setter methods in the PizzaBuilder class to set the attributes of the pizza
3. Add a method in the PizzaBuilder class to build the pizza:
4. buildPizza(): Pizza: Return the constructed pizza object.
5. In the Main class, create an instance of the PizzaBuilder class.
11. Use the setter methods of the PizzaBuilder class to set the attributes of the pizza.
13. Invoke the buildPizza() method of the PizzaBuilder class to obtain the constructed pizza object.
15. Test the implementation by printing the details of the constructed pizza.

Best of luck with the exercise!
